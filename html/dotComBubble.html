                The two laws in which the internet is based off of is Moore's Law and Metcalfe's law.

            <p class="container-fluid text-justify">Moore’s Law states that the speed and power of integrated circuits from microprocessor’s to memory chips doubles every 18 months. The reason for double is so that if one were to look overtime to see the number of steps it takes to double; many steps aren’t needed. Henceforth with very few steps, there is remarkable growth. The logic behind this founded double. Giving engineers the ability to make transistors smaller and smaller on a chip. Reasoning to why computers overtime begins to decrease in its size.
                How transistors are etched, and thteame material used to etch them on determines the speed of chips. With each chip becoming denser over the years, the evolution has become auto catalytic. Meaning within the same set of an entity there is potential for growth to occur at a higher pace.
                Once Moore made the declaration of his law, it became the standard for microprocessor designers in order to provide the double. </p>

            <p class="container-fluid text-justify">What also paired alongside the technological growth of the web was a rule by Robert Metcalfe’s. The inventor of the ethernet. Metcalf’s laws states that every new node (computer) added to a network does not increase the value of a network by plus one. The curve within the value of the network is increasingly higher. Henceforth, the Moore’s law of connectivity.
                The more nodes present the more increasing of pairs of communication present. •	Considering the growth of the internet Metcalf law shows that the internet gathers momentum as it functions. Meaning, that as the number of user increases the usefulness of the network increases and it becomes compelling over time for new users to join the internet. </p>

Along came faster, cheaper and more powerful computers being connected together at a high rate. Making the internet exponentially more useful and more popular.

                At the time, Amazon was highly known for its book selling. While eBay found value its bidding system for those looking to collect and trade items.
                Amazon and eBay are prolific companies that found increasing growth and highly influenced the growth of Ecommerce. Those on the stock market were totally clueless as to how the internet worked.
                But, those on the stock market found ways in which it could help them generate more money. It was also this year during summer 95' Netscape introduced its initial public offering. A year later arrived the IPO's of search engine companies such as Yahoo and Excite.
                A year later after that, Amazon takes the next step in pushing the boom of the internet into the state of bubble hood.</p>
