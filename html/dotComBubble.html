    <p class="container-fluid text-justify" >The growth of the internet was faster than the introduction to radio and television. With the internet it took only 4 years once opened to the public to reach 50 million users.
        The two laws in which the internet is based off of is Moore's Law and Metcalfe's law.

        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">Moore’s Law states that the speed and power of integrated circuits from microprocessor’s to memory chips doubles every 18 months. The reason for double is so that if one were to look overtime to see the number of steps it takes to double; many steps aren’t needed. Henceforth with very few steps, there is remarkable growth. The logic behind this founded double. Giving engineers the ability to make transistors smaller and smaller on a chip. Reasoning to why computers overtime begins to decrease in its size.
            How transistors are etched, and the material used to etch them on determines the speed of chips. With each chip becoming denser over the years, the evolution has become auto catalytic. Meaning within the same set of an entity there is potential for growth to occur at a higher pace.
            Once Moore made the declaration of his law, it became the standard for microprocessor designers in order to provide the double. </p>

        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">What also paired alongside the technological growth of the web was a rule by Robert Metcalfe’s. The inventor of the ethernet. Metcalf’s laws states that every new node (computer) added to a network does not increase the value of a network by plus one. The curve within the value of the network is increasingly higher. Henceforth, the Moore’s law of connectivity.
            The more nodes present the more increasing of pairs of communication present. •	Considering the growth of the internet Metcalf law shows that the internet gathers momentum as it functions. Meaning, that as the number of user increases the usefulness of the network increases and it becomes compelling over time for new users to join the internet. </p>

        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">By the mid 90s Moore’s law and Metcalf's law worked hand in hand to fuel a rapid growth. Along came faster, cheaper and more powerful computers being connected together at a high rate. Making the internet exponentially more useful and more popular.

            At the time, Amazon was highly known for its book selling. While eBay found value its bidding system for those looking to collect and trade items.
            Amazon and eBay are prolific companies that found increasing growth and highly influenced the growth of Ecommerce. Those on the stock market were totally clueless as to how the internet worked.
            But, those on the stock market found ways in which it could help them generate more money. It was also this year during summer 95' Netscape introduced its initial public offering. A year later arrived the IPO's of search engine companies such as Yahoo and Excite.
            A year later after that, Amazon takes the next step in pushing the boom of the internet into the state of bubble hood.</p>

        <p class="container-fluid text-justify" >Soon after, there was a rise in the use of ARPANET networks everywhere but with the growth of the ARPANET came the problem of standardization. Computers need a way to understand each other regardless of the operating system. This way of communication is a language like the one we use to communicate. Like human language, computer protocols are nothing but a set of rules that enabled computers to understand each other. The set of protocols used in this case are the TCP/IP protocol stack. The TCP/IP protocol stack was introduced in 1973 by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn. The goal was to link networks (LANs and WANs) with each other. Today, all devices that connect to the internet must comply with the TCP/IP protocol stack. Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn introduced the concept of gateways where packets can leave and enter different networks. There were other protocol stacks proposed but TCP/IP ultimately won the internet protocol war.</p>

What telecommunications companies offer you is the availability of becoming one of their many computers in their network. The internet is free (as in freedom, not free beer) because on June 9th, 1992 Congress passed a bill that took the internet out the hands of the government and passed to the public so that anyone can use it for whatever reason they wish.</p>

        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">By the 1980s, the internet was widely available to those who knew how to use it. Looking for information was hard because there was no Google or anything that resembles it. This problem was solved by Tim Berners Lee who invented the World Wide Web. WWW made the following threads of information easy by following links. In 1992 there were only 50 pages available but in 1993 the web browser was invented by Marc Andreessen at the University of Illinois. Mosaic, later known as Netscape was the first graphical user interface that made using the internet simple and user friendly. No longer people needed to be computer wizards to search the web.</p>
