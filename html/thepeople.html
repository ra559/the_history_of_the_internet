        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">Everyone in the 21st century craves and seeks out something more valuable than love, money or power.
            People within the 21st focus their upmost attention on communication. They way humans communicate in
            this day and age surely differs from the days of the past. Smoke signals, telegraphs, newspapers and
            morse coded are surely things of the past. The uprising of communication rapidly seems to increase as
            the years continue to head forward. What you might say is taking our communication forward faster almost
            as fast as the speed of light ? Well, it is the Word Wide Web also known as the internet.</p>

        </figure>
        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">Established in 1999, Napster became a set of three music-centered online
            services. It was established as a spearheading distributed (P2P) file sharing Internet software that underlined
            sharing computerized sound documents, normally sound tunes, encoded in MP3 design Napster and the mp3 revolution
            and becoming the first place to be considered as a web community. Napster revolutionized the way online users
            became active on the internet. Sites such as facebook, friendster and myspace were looking to replicate the same
            community based hub that Napster transformed into. Napster was a hobby which later turned into a business where
            future venture capitalist would want to get their hands on. The success that Napster was beginning to gain had
            not gone unnoticed. Taken noticed by the head of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Hilary Rosen,
            she noticed the uprising of Napster’s operations. You see the RIAA was an organization set up to protect the
            interests and revenues of the music business within America. In 2000, the American musical recording company
            A&amp;M Records along with several others, through the RIAA, sued Napster on grounds of copyright infringement
            under the DMCA, which led to the shutting down of the pioneering peer-to-peer file sharing service. Subsequently
            enough, this also introduced the rule of copyright infringement within the digital age.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Youtube Impacting Big Media</h3>
        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">YouTube is an American online video-sharing stage settled in San Bruno, California. Three previous PayPal workers
            Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim—made the service in February 2005. Google purchased the site in November
            2006 for US$1.65 billion. As of late Youtube operates as on of Google’s subsidiaries. Meaning Youtube belongs to
            Google , but, they operate as their own entity. Initially, Youtube became a place where millions of people were
            able to post and share copyrighted material. At one point Youtube was a big threat on big media due to its reformed
            way of distributing media. Youtube allowed its users to create space where they are able to create their own content
            and entertain those near and far. Youtube has been in the forefront of user generated content. Offering users the
            ability to express their creativity. This marked an era in which Youtube helped shifted the internet. This was an
            era in which content was created by users. What came along in this era, was the era of Web 2.0.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h3 class="text-center">Web 2.0</h3>
        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">Web 2.0 refers to websites that emphasize user-generated content, ease of use, participatory culture and
            interoperability for end users. Web 2.0 introduced itself during the new age of social networking, right
            after the downfall of the dotcom crash. In the rise of Web 2.0 there came Friendster and Myspace. Amongst
            the two, Myspace quickly became popular due to its ability to allow the user to change the appearance and
            feel of their profiles. Similar to its predecessors, MySpace’s’ popular was due to its ability to share
            and access music.</p>

        </figure>
        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">What also became the new face in the uprising of social made was Facebook. Being a simple start up idea, Mark
            Zuckerberg and his team of developers later turned Facebook into the new crave that would sweep the world wide web.
            Only taking less than two weeks to be developed. With the demand from college students alike. The demand for
            Facebook from college students had increased. The expansion of the social medium soon hit the internet quickly.
            The initial goal of Facebook was to create a service that captures the totality of human connections.
            Which in simple terms to create an ultimate relationship engine.</p>
        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">The foundation of Facebook stood on top of what is called the social graph. Stepping into the real2m of social
            network analysis, the social graph is concept. The concept simply states that all people are bound together
            by a web of relationships. Some ties can be direct and prolific while others can be feeble and weak. All in
            all these web of relationships lead to paths of common relationships that connects everyone together. With
            this concept in mind Zuckerberg believed that this concept was not only for Facebook. The concepts and methodologies
            behind what fuels Facebook can also be a role model for those within the realm of advertisements. The Web we know now,
            which loads into a program window in basically static screenfuls, is just an incipient organism of the Web to come.
            The main glimmerings of Web 2.0 are starting to show up, and we are simply beginning to perceive how that incipient
            organism may create. The Web will be perceived not as screenfuls of text and illustrations yet as a vehicle system,
            the ether through which intelligence occurs.</p>
