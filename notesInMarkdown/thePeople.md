Napster's operations. You see the RIAA was an organization set up to protect the interests and revenues of the music business within America. In 2000, the American musical recording company A&M Records along with several others, through the RIAA, sued Napster on grounds of copyright infringement under the DMCA, which led to the shutting down of the pioneering peer-to-peer file sharing service.

What came along in this era, 
was the era of Web 2.0. 


### Web 2.0 

Web 2.0 refers to websites that emphasize user-generated content, ease of use, participatory culture and interoperability for end users. Web 2.0 introduced itself during the new age of social networking, right after the downfall of the dotcom crash. In the rise of Web 2.0 there came Friendster and Myspace. Amongst the two, Myspace quickly became popular due to its ability to allow the user to change the appearance and feel of their profiles. Similar to its predecessors, MySpace's' popular was due to its ability to share and access music. 

What also became the new face in the uprising of social made was Facebook.

The foundation of Facebook stood on top of what is called the social graph. Stepping into the real2m of social network analysis, the social graph is concept. The concept simply states that all people are bound together by a web of relationships. Some ties can be direct and prolific while others can be feeble and weak. All in all these web of relationships lead to paths of common relationships that connects everyone together. With this concept in mind Zuckerberg believed that this concept was not only for Facebook. The concepts and methodologies behind what fuels Facebook can also be a role model for those 
within the realm of advertisements. 
The Web we know now, which loads into a program window in basically static screenfuls, is just an incipient organism of the Web to come. The main glimmerings of Web 2.0 are starting to show up, and we are simply beginning to perceive how that incipient organism may create. The Web will be perceived not as screenfuls of text and illustrations yet as a vehicle system, the ether through which intelligence occurs.
