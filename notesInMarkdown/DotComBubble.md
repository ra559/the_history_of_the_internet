Spanning from 1995 till the early 2000s, the dot-com bubble also known as the internet bubble; was a period of massive growth in the use and the adoption of the internet.


# What Powers the Internet

The growth of the internet was faster than the introduction to radio and television. With the internet it took only 4 years once opened to the public to reach 50 million users. 
The two laws in which the internet is based off of is Moore's Law and Metcalfe's law. 

## Gordon Moore's Law

Moore’s Law states that the speed and power of integrated circuits from microprocessor’s to memory chips doubles every 18 months. The reason for double is so that if one were to look overtime to see the number of steps it takes to double; many steps aren’t needed. Henceforth with very few steps, there is remarkable growth. The logic behind this founded double. Giving engineers the ability to make transistors smaller and smaller on a chip. Reasoning to why computers overtime begins to decrease in its size. 
How transistors are etched, and the material used to etch them on determines the speed of chips. With each chip becoming denser over the years, the evolution has become auto catalytic. Meaning within the same set of an entity there is potential for growth to occur at a higher pace. 
Once Moore made the declaration of his law, it became the standard for microprocessor designers in order to provide the double. 

# Robert Metcalf's Law 

What also paired alongside the technological growth of the web was a rule by Robert Metcalfe’s. The inventor of the ethernet. Metcalf’s laws states that every new node (computer) added to a network does not increase the value of a network by plus one. The curve within the value of the network is increasingly higher. Henceforth, the Moore’s law of connectivity. 
The more nodes present the more increasing of pairs of communication present. •	Considering the growth of the internet Metcalf law shows that the internet gathers momentum as it functions. Meaning, that as the number of user increases the usefulness of the network increases and it becomes compelling over time for new users to join the internet. 

## The Bases On Which the Internet Operates 
By the mid 90s Moore’s law and Metcalf's law worked hand in hand to fuel a rapid growth. Along came faster, cheaper and more powerful computers being connected together at a high rate. Making the internet exponentially more useful and more popular.

## What is Ecommerce ? 
Ecommerce, also known as electronic commerce or internet commerce, refers to the buying and selling of goods or services using the internet, and the transfer of money and data to execute these transactions.

## The Growth of Ecommerce Technology 
It was during the year 1995 where online marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay began to take their respective strides within commerce. 
At the time, Amazon was highly known for its book selling. While eBay found value its bidding system for those looking to collect and trade items. 
Amazon and eBay are prolific companies that found increasing growth and highly influenced the growth of Ecommerce. Those on the stock market were totally clueless as to how the internet worked. But, those on the stock market found ways in which it could help them 
generate more money. It was also this year during summer 95' Netscape introduced its initial public offering. A year later arrived the IPO's of search engine companies.
