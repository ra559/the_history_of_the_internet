# The Internet Search

The roots of the search engine started at Stanford University with two bored electrical engineering students who had the genius idea of indexing data about fantasy basketball over the internet.  The basic idea was to create a directory to navigate all the collected data. Before search engines browsing the internet meant going from one FTP server to another.

Jerry Yang and David Filo founded Yahoo!  in January 1994  and incorporated it on March 2, 1995. Yahoo!’s business model relied on advertisements. The company was worried that using advertisement was a risky business because users could simply rebel and not use Yahoo at all. Soon after, Yahoo!’s advertising triggered the goal rush that until today still matters. With the success of Yahoo! came competition and one of the biggest competitors was Excite. 


The battle between Yahoo! And Excite was not different than it is today with Bing and Google. If Yahoo! Came out with a product so did Excite and vice versa. For both of these companies the larger the user base the more money in advertising they could make. But with the focus on advertising, both Yahoo! And Excite as well as the rest of the competition, was falling behind in their search algorithms. 


Meanwhile, the search engine companies were focused on advertising, a newcomer to the game would pose the challenge that years later will make almost all the competition disappear.  January 1996 Larry Page and Sergey Brin started their research on a better search engine. Their core idea was that the internet was running a popularity contest with its own content, therefore, the more views a page got the more relevant its content was. In summary of Page and Brin’s 1998 academic paper:

In essence, Google interprets a link in page A to page B as a vote by page A for page B. Google then assesses the page’s importance by the votes it receives.


Page and Brin launched Google in Stanford University’s Network and it almost broke the network due to how popular it quickly became. Stanford University then kicked google out of its network and Page and Brin started their search for funding. The first person to envision the Google project was Vinod Khosla a venture capitalist who at the time had invested in Excite and wanted Excite to license the search engine from Page and Brin. Google and Excite had a meeting but the Excite executives did not agree to license or buy the Google search engine. In their minds, internet search was genetic and the Excite search engine was almost as good. Excite could have bought google back then for 1 Million dollars and be today’s biggest tech company but they passed on the offer (what a mistake!!). 


Excite was not the only company that turned down Page and Larry’s invention. Pretty much every search engine company did because no one believed that you could make real money with search engines alone. They all relied on advertising. However, the Google team did not give up, instead, they looked for help from one of their professors; David R. Cheriton. David, who had some money from a startup that got bought by CISCO, contacted Andy Bechtolsheim to introduce him to the Google team. When the team showed Andy a demo of Google, Andy wrote them a check for 100,000 dollars on the spot because Google was the best idea he had ever been presented with. Eventually, Page and Brin met John Doerr who is the biggest venture capitalist of Silicon Valley. Doerr was convinced of Google’s revenue potential and wrote Page and Brin a check for 12 Million dollars.

Google did not want to base their business model around advertising. Doing so would have turned google into just another search engine. This problem was solved by Bill Gross who realized that when people were searching for information their queries told not only their interest but also what the7y we interested in buying. This could turn an efficient search engine into a marketing tool. Bill Gross’s idea was to monetize the keywords that users enter in the search engine. For instance, BMW would pay a fortune to make sure that the word “car” returns its website instead of Mattel’s Hotwheels. Gross’ idea turned the internet into a yellow pages book. It was this idea that Google mirror. Google named its product Adwords and it was just a copy of Bill Gross Overpage.
